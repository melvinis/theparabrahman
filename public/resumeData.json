    "bio":"I am a highly versatile, articulate and innovative individual with an extensive depth of knowledge in technology and a broad spectrum of experience in several areas of retail banking. In addition to being adept at developing and driving strategy, I possess detailed knowledge, experience and skill in payments, analytics, channel development and the strategic development of banking (internet and mobile based) channels. Iâ€™ve always believed that transactional banking will be commoditized, and I am keen to be at the forefront to usher in the platform approach through Open Banking .",
